### A Portfolio Website Projects

Codux is an all-in-one visual development environment. Whether youâ€™re starting a new app, creating components, or editing an existing project, every visual change you make reflects instantly in the code and vice versa. To learn more about Codux, visit our website - [https://www.codux.com/](https://www.codux.com/)

This project was bootstrapped with [`Vite`](https://vitejs.dev).

It includes a single React component to start your project with, a sample [`codux.config.json`](codux.config.json) with preconfigured keys, a `package.json` file to describe the project's packages and dependencies, and a folder and component structure to put everything neatly in its place.

- Edit, render and compose apps that make use of **`React`**-based components.
- Create components with **`TypeScript`**, **`SCSS`** and **`CSS Modules`** support.
- Visually edit in real-time and in an isolated environment.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run build`

Build the application in production mode into a folder named `dist`. This folder can be served using any HTTP server.

### `npm run dev`

Start dev server, aliases: `vite dev`, `vite serve`.\
Open [http://127.0.0.1:5173/](http://127.0.0.1:5173/) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run preview`

Boots up a local static web server that serves the files from dist at [`http://localhost:4173`](http://localhost:4173) . It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.
